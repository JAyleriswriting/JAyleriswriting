<p>I cup my hands against the window of the door, peeking into the darkened room that I deem only contains animals as it has previous times at a first glance. But I notice the subtle movements of a tall, human-like character standing in the farthest corner of the area... Wearing a red wraparound dress dusted with cobalt glitter, the unidentified person has the physique of a woman. But does this make it safe to assume they're a woman...?</p>
 
<p>She slowly turns towards me and I'm bewitched by her soft, blue eyes radiating in the blackout she's in. Her hair is blonde and curly, floating in the air around her while she moves with grace, seeming to glide my way. And as this mystic woman now stands exactly before me on the opposite side of the door, I take a tiny step back. Her singleness is so much that I'm unable to think, only stare in amazement at her appearance.</p>

<p>Jayden slowly raises her lips into a sinister smirk that silences the undertones of our spectators. But after seconds of her upturned expression, it begins fading away while her deathly glare remains. She wraps around me tighter as I cuddle into her undying protection.</p>

<p>The air you’re casting is clear and fresh; allow your mind to be the same because toxic thoughts will only pollute it. Use the precious invisible substance we’re surrounded by to take deep inspires of focus and exhales of dynamism.</p>
